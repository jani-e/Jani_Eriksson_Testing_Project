> Please use the below questions to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- 
     This was my first time using GitLab so before testing I had to get used to the webapp itself. Once familiar with the webapp, the test cases felt easy and logical to perform.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case?
- 
    I wrote my test cases in the given .md files. I wrote the description, tags, variables that will be used in the test cases, titles for both positive and negative test cases, and finally the process of steps in the test case simultaneously while doing the test case in the Webapp.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management
 -     
    I do not have any experience with testing tools. I would prefer tools that
    assist and support the user by giving easy-to-update templates to the user. Jira seems to be a good option for Agile Software Development.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- 
    I have used two IDEs: Eclipse and Netbeans for Java programming. For Web design (HTML, CSS, JS) I have used Visual Studio Code and Notepad++.

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- 
    Testing a new platform that I had no experience with could be considered as trouble. The trouble was resolved by navigating and clicking through pages and buttons in the Webapp platform.

## 6. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other)
- 
    Robot Framework seems like a good candidate to automate these test cases. The test cases seem to be already nearly in the same format Robot Framework uses. Just the resources would require some editing with ${} signs.


## 7. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- 
    Based on search results from indeed.com.
    Skills and competencies in software testing:
    - Familiarity with Software Development Life Cycle
    - Proactive, Critical thinking, eager to learn
    - Good Team player
    - Previous testing or development experience
    - Good communication and attitude
    - Bachelor's degree preferably in Computer Science, Information technology, Computer Engineering, or related IT discipline or equivalent experience


## 8. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- 
    I would certainly need some real experience with testing tools. Also more information on the process of the Software Development Life Cycle. For soft skills I would say that critical thinking in testing perspective is important. This of course requires more experience in testing.


## 9. Are you going to apply for ISTQB Foundation level Certification?
- 
    No, I am not going to apply for the ISTQB certification because I feel more excited in performing developer activities than tester activities. Like it was mentioned during the course, I feel like I have more of a developer mindset than a tester mindset.
